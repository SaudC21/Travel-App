# Udacity Front End Nanodegree - Travel App Project

This project is the final capstone project for Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

## Project Overview

This project aims to give me the opportunity to put all of the skills we've learned into one project to build my own custom travel app. Due to the nature of this course, it is very JavaScript heavy, but I worked on creating clean and appealing HTML/CSS. Fruthermore, targeting the DOM, working with objects, and retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. Finally, this is all going to be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server, and wrapped up with service workers.

## Way to Stand Out
I Pulled in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results.
